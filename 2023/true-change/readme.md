# true change

Jesse: How do you not hate yourself?

Group leader: I did hate myself for a long time. But it didn't stop me from
drinking and getting high. It just made it that much worse. Self-hatred, guilt,
it accomplishes nothing. It just stands in the way.

Jesse: Stands in the way of what?

Group leader: True change.
