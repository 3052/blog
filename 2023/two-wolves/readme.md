# Two wolves

> One time, on a sweltering August night, Grandfather and I made camp down by
> the ocean. He said, “While I teach you about the ways of war, I want you to
> know that the real struggle is between the two wolves that live inside each
> of us.”
>
> “Two wolves?” I asked, seated on an old log near the fire. My eyes were
> transfixed by the flames twisting uncomfortably in the night air.
>
> “One wolf is evil,” he continued. “It is anger, envy, greed, arrogance,
> self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, deceit, false pride.” He paused,
> poking at the embers of our fire with a long stick he’d been carving.
>
> “The other is good. It is joy, love, hope, serenity, humility,
> loving-kindness, forgiveness, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion,
> faith.”
>
> I considered that for a minute, then tentatively asked, “Which wolf will
> win?”
>
> Sparks danced towards the stars as the old man stared into the glare of the
> flames and replied, “Whichever one you feed.”
