# powershell

This:

https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v7.3.0

is the first non-preview release to correctly escape this type of command:

~~~
curl.exe --trace trace.txt --json '{ "drink": "coffe" }' https://example.com
~~~

these are small:

~~~
PowerShell-7.3.0-win-fxdependent.zip
PowerShell-7.3.0-win-fxdependentWinDesktop.zip
~~~

but much slower. get one of these:

~~~
PowerShell-7.3.0-win-x64.zip
PowerShell-7.3.0-win-x86.zip
~~~
