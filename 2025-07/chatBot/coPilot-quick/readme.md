# coPilot quick response

provide prompt I can give you to return this script

one file pass. 10 chances to get to two files. chance 1:

Please give me the complete Go program (standard library only) that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI (`go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`)
- Starts with `const defaultBase = "http://test.test/test.mpd"`
- Resolves all nested `<BaseURL>` tags using only `net/url.Parse` and `net/url.URL.ResolveReference`
- Outputs a JSON map from each `Representation.ID` to its ordered list of fully resolved segment URLs
- Supports both `<SegmentList>` and `<SegmentTemplate>` elements from either AdaptationSet or Representation
- Handles `$RepresentationID$`, `$Number$`, `$Number%0Nd$`, `$Time$`, `$Time%0Nd$` placeholders
- Accumulates `$Time$` across `<SegmentTimeline><S>` elements

chance 2:

~~~
142:40: cannot use &mpd.BaseURL (value of type **BaseURL) as *BaseURL value in
argument to resolveBaseURL
~~~

chance 3:

`end := strings.Index(template[start:], "$")` is not correct as it matches the
starting token

chance 4:

`end += start + 1` is not correct, as it will exclude the final token

chance 5:

each S element should be used 1 + S@r times

need to burn another chance since it did not create a script. chance 6:

complete Go program

chance 7:

complete Go program that reads an MPEG-DASH MPD

chance 8:

Outputs a JSON map from each `Representation.ID` to its ordered list of fully
resolved segment URLs

chance 9:

input should be local file, no network requests

chance 10:

SegmentTemplate@duration is optional
