four file pass

Please provide a complete, self-contained Go script in a single `main.go` file
that performs the following actions:

## ðŸ“œ Script Requirements

### 1. Execution
* The script must parse a local MPEG-DASH MPD file path passed as a command-line argument: `go run main.go <path_to_mpd_file>`.

---
### 2. URL Resolution
* It must use the hardcoded URL `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the top-level base for resolving all relative paths.
* **Resolution Hierarchy**: The script must correctly resolve relative URLs by respecting the following hierarchy of `<BaseURL>` elements, from highest to lowest scope:
  1. `<Period>`
  2. `<Representation>`
* A `<BaseURL>` at a lower level (e.g., `Representation`) is resolved relative to the base URL established by the level above it (e.g., `Period`). All relative paths within that scope are then resolved against this new, more specific base URL.

---
### 3. Inheritance
* A `Representation` must inherit `<SegmentTemplate>`, `<SegmentList>`, and `<Initialization>` elements from its parent `AdaptationSet`.
* Any element or attribute defined directly on a `Representation` must override the corresponding one inherited from the `AdaptationSet`.

---
### 4. Initialization Segment
* The script must find the initialization segment URL by checking for its definition in the following order of precedence (from highest to lowest):
  1. An `<Initialization>` element that is a direct child of the `Representation`.
  2. An `<Initialization>` element that is a child of the effective `<SegmentList>`.
  3. The `initialization` attribute on the effective `<SegmentTemplate>`.
* The resulting initialization segment URL must be the first element in the final URL list for that representation.

---
### 5. Segment Generation
* The script must generate the list of media segments using the first available method from the following list of precedence:
  1. **Primary (`<SegmentTimeline>`)**: If the effective `<SegmentTemplate>` contains a `<SegmentTimeline>`, iterate through its `<S>` elements, correctly handling `t` (time), `d` (duration), and `r` (repeat) attributes. The segment number should be tracked starting from `SegmentTemplate@startNumber` (or 1).
  2. **Secondary (`<SegmentList>`)**: If no `<SegmentTimeline>` is found, use the effective `<SegmentList>` and create a URL for each of its `<SegmentURL>` children.
  3. **Tertiary (Number-based Template)**: If the above are missing and the `SegmentTemplate@endNumber` attribute is present, calculate the total number of segments based on `startNumber` and `endNumber`.
  4. **Quaternary (Duration-based Template)**: If the above are missing, use the effective `<SegmentTemplate>`'s `duration` and `timescale` attributes to calculate the total number of segments. The calculation must use the **`Period@duration`**. If `Period@duration` is missing, it should fall back to using `MPD@mediaPresentationDuration`.
  5. **Final Fallback (`<BaseURL>` List)**: If no other segment information exists, treat any `<BaseURL>` elements that are direct children of the `Representation` as a literal list of segment URLs.
* **Default Values**:
    * If `SegmentTemplate@timescale` is omitted, it must default to `1`.
    * If `SegmentTemplate@startNumber` is omitted, it must default to `1`.

---
### 6. Placeholder Substitution
* The script must correctly substitute `$RepresentationID$`, `$Number$`, and `$Time$` placeholders when constructing final segment URLs.
* Substitution must support `printf`-style formatting for width and zero-padding, such as `$Number%05d$`.

---
### 7. Multi-Period Representations
* If the same `Representation@id` appears in multiple `<Period>` elements, the script must append the media segments from subsequent periods to the list for that representation.
* The initialization segment should only be added once, from the first period in which the representation is encountered.

---
### 8. Output
* The script must print a single, indented JSON object to standard output.
* This JSON object should map each `Representation@id` string to a list of fully resolved segment URL strings: `{ "rep_id": ["init_url", "segment_1_url", ...] }`.

---

- Resolves `<BaseURL>` elements hierarchically: MPD â†’ Period â†’ AdaptationSet â†’ Representation
- Handles:
  - `startNumber` and `endNumber`
  - `$Time$` using `<SegmentTimeline>` and `@r` repetitions (each `<S>` repeated `1 + r` times)
- Uses **only** `net/url.URL.ResolveReference` for URL resolving (no other logic)
- Prefers `Period@duration` over `MPD@mediaPresentationDuration` for segment count calculations
