Please provide the Go source code for a DASH MPD segment expander that meets the following requirements:

1. **Input**: Accepts the path to a local `.mpd` file as the first command-line argument.
2. **Base URL**: Uses the fixed base URL `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the default if no `BaseURL` is specified in the MPD.
3. **Output**: Outputs pure JSON to stdout in the format `{"RepresentationID":["absolute_url",…],…}`.
4. **Error Handling**: Checks and propagates all errors for `strconv.Atoi`, `url.Parse`, and other operations, exiting with an error message to stderr on failure.
5. **Start Number**: Distinguishes between absent `startNumber` (defaults to 1) and explicit `startNumber="0"`.
6. **Segment Count Calculation**: For simple mode (when `@endNumber` is absent), dynamically calculates the number of segments using `Period` duration and `SegmentTemplate` duration/timescale.
7. **SegmentTimeline Mode**: Supports `<SegmentTimeline>` by parsing `<S>` elements with `@t`, `@d`, and `@r`, correctly incrementing `$Time$` across `<S>` elements (using `@t` when present, inferring it when absent).
8. **EndNumber Mode**: Supports simple `@startNumber … @endNumber` mode by parsing `@endNumber` if present.
9. **SegmentTemplate Location**: Supports `<SegmentTemplate>` at either `<AdaptationSet>` or `<Representation>` level, with `<Representation>` taking precedence.
10. **Placeholder Expansion**: Expands `$RepresentationID$`, `$Number$`, `$Time$`, and `%0xd` padding in `@media`. Validates that `@initialization` does not contain `$Number$` or `$Time$` placeholders.
11. **BaseURL Hierarchy**: Resolves the `BaseURL` hierarchy (`MPD` → `Period` → `AdaptationSet` → `Representation`), with lower levels overriding higher ones, and falls back to the default `http://test.test/test.mpd` if no `BaseURL` is specified.
12. **Additional Notes**:
    - Uses `parseISODuration` to handle simple ISO 8601 durations (e.g., `PTnS`) for `Period` duration.
    - Defaults period duration to 3600 seconds (1 hour) if absent and `@endNumber` is not provided.
    - Defaults timescale to 1 if absent.
    - Assumes `@endNumber` is an extension; supports it as specified.
    - Allows plain `$Number$` and `$Time$` without `%0xd` formatting (uses `%d`).
    - Validates `@t` consistency in `<SegmentTimeline>` (non-negative, not decreasing for subsequent elements).
    - Rejects `$Number$` and `$Time$` in `@initialization` per DASH spec.

Please provide the complete Go source code, ensuring it matches the functionality of the script previously provided (artifact ID: `166e4ab4-8fd8-4a5b-9280-275107c56a4e`, version ID: `b29c2270-ea70-4b7e-a569-c46c21c5e7fa`), including:
- Correct `$Time$` increment across `<S>` elements in `<SegmentTimeline>`.
- Proper `BaseURL` hierarchy resolution.
- All error handling and validations as specified.
- No external dependencies beyond the Go standard library.

4. Expands:  
   - `<SegmentList>` that may appear on `<AdaptationSet>` **or** `<Representation>`  
   - When neither `@endNumber` nor `<SegmentTimeline>` are present, derives the segment count as  
     `ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * SegmentTemplate@timescale / SegmentTemplate@duration)`  
     (use `SegmentTemplate@timescale = 1` if absent).  
   - Missing `@startNumber` (attribute absent) defaults to **1**; explicit `startNumber="0"` is honoured.  
5. If a `<Representation>` has **neither** `<SegmentTemplate>` **nor** `<SegmentList>`, emit the single absolute URL derived from its effective BaseURL.  
7. All other diagnostics (usage help, errors) go to stderr.  
8. **Eliminates duplicate segment URLs for each representation**, even when the same Representation ID appears in multiple Periods.  
9. **No external dependencies** beyond the Go standard library.  
10. **Appends** segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple Periods.  
12. Handles full ISO-8601 durations (e.g., `PT2H13M19.040S`).  
14. `$Number$` **always** equals the segment number (starting from `startNumber`).  
15. `$Time$` **always** equals the presentation-time offset (in timescale units).  
16. Correctly replaces `$Number%0xd$` and `$Time%0xd$` with zero-padded values.  
17. **All URL resolution** must be performed exclusively with `net/url.URL.ResolveReference`—no custom or other URL logic.  
18. Every `strconv`, `url.Parse`, `ParseFloat`, etc. **must** be checked and its error propagated.
