# chatGpt 4.1-mini

## prompt 1, 14s

Please provide a complete Go script that:

- Takes a local MPEG-DASH MPD file path as a CLI argument (`go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`)
- Parses the MPD and outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to
   a list of fully resolved segment URLs with the initialization segment first
   if present
- Uses base URL `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial base for URL resolution

## prompt 2, 15s

SegmentTemplate can be child of Representation or AdaptationSet

## prompt 3, 12s

`collectSegmentURLs` is adding a limit of one when I did not ask that

## prompt 4, 16s

updated script

## prompt 5, 7s

replace `$RepresentationID$`

## prompt 6, 17s

entire script

## prompt 7, 18s

replace `$Time$`

## prompt 8, 10s

respect Period@BaseURL

## prompt 9, 16s

updated script

## prompt 10, 25s

support SegmentTemplate@endNumber

## prompt 11, 8s

When a representation has only BaseURL and no segment information, use the
already-resolved baseURL directly

## prompt 12, 6s

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 13, 24s

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## prompt 14, 7s

replace input like `$Number%08d$`

## prompt 15, 22s
