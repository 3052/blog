this model fails. after nine chances it could not pass the first test file

## chance 1

Please provide a complete Go script that:

- Takes a local MPEG-DASH MPD file path as a CLI argument (`go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`).
- Parses the MPD and outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to
   a list of fully resolved segment URLs with the initialization segment first
   if present
- Uses base URL `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial base for URL resolution.

## chance 2

Error parsing MPD XML: main.MPD field "Period" with tag "Period" conflicts with
field "Periods" with tag "Period"

## chance 3

use only net/url.URL.ResolveReference to resolve URLs, no other package or logic

## chance 4

SegmentTemplate can be child of Representation or AdaptationSet

## chance 5

Supports substitution variables `$RepresentationID$`, `$Number$`, `$Time$` in
templates, including printf-style formatting like `$Number%05d$`

## chance 6

`substituteTemplateVars(mediaPattern, rep.ID, i, 0)` incorrectly uses zero
value for `$Time$`

## chance 7

support SegmentTimeline

## chance 8

279:7: declared and not used: timescale

## chance 9

`prevT = segments[len(segments)-1]` is incorrect, as it should instead be the
final segment value + S@d
