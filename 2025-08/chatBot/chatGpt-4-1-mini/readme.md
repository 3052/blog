## prompt 1

Please provide a complete Go script that:

- Takes a local MPEG-DASH MPD file path as a CLI argument (`go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`)
- Parses the MPD and outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to
   a list of fully resolved segment URLs with the initialization segment first
   if present
- Uses base URL `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial base for URL resolution

## prompt 2

Error parsing MPD XML: main.MPD field "Period" with tag "Period" conflicts with
field "Periods" with tag "Period"

## prompt 3

SegmentTemplate can be child of Representation or AdaptationSet

## prompt 4

support SegmentTimeline

## prompt 5

handle `$RepresentationID$`

## prompt 6

with each iteration, `$Time$` should be replaced, then incremented by the
current S@d value, in that order, no other logic should happen

## prompt 7

if SegmentTemplate@endNumber exists it sets value of the last segment

## prompt 8

if a Representation supplies its own `<BaseURL>` and there is no `SegmentList`
or `SegmentTemplate` at any level, outputs just that single resolved URL

## prompt 9

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 10

respect input like `$Number%08d$`

## prompt 11

Default `timescale` to `1` if missing

## prompt 12

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`
