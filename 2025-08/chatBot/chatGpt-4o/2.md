Sure — here's the unquoted version of the prompt so you can copy it directly:

Please return a full Go script that:

* Parses a local MPEG-DASH MPD XML file from a CLI argument: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
* Uses base URL: `http://test.test/test.mpd`
* Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs, with the `initialization` segment first (if present)
* Fully supports SegmentTemplate with:

  * `$Number$` substitution
  * `$Time$` substitution using `<SegmentTimeline>`
  * `startNumber` and `endNumber` attributes
* Uses only the Go standard library
