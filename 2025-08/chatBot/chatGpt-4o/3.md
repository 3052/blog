Please return a full Go script (using only the standard library) that:

* Parses a local MPEG-DASH MPD XML file passed as a CLI argument: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
* Uses base URL: `http://test.test/test.mpd`
* Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs, with the initialization segment first if present
* Fully supports:

  * `SegmentTemplate` with `$Number$`, `$Time$`, `startNumber`, `endNumber`, and `<SegmentTimeline>`
  * `SegmentList` with `<Initialization>` and `<SegmentURL>`
  * `<BaseURL>` elements at the `Period` and `Representation` levels
* If a `Representation` defines its own `<BaseURL>` but there is no `SegmentTemplate` or `SegmentList` at any level, output just the single resolved URL
