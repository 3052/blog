Please return a complete Go script (using only the standard library) that:

* Parses a local MPEG-DASH MPD XML file provided as a CLI argument: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
* Uses `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the base URL
* Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs
* Fully supports:

  * `SegmentTemplate` with `$Number$`, `$Time$`, `startNumber`, `endNumber`, `duration`, `timescale`, and `<SegmentTimeline>`
  * C-style formatting in segment URLs (e.g., `$Number%08d$`, `$Time%05d$`)
  * `SegmentList` with `<Initialization>` and `<SegmentURL>`
  * `<BaseURL>` elements at the `Period` and `Representation` levels
* If no `SegmentTimeline` or `endNumber` is present, but `duration` and `timescale` are, estimate segment count using:
  `ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`
* If a `Representation` defines its own `<BaseURL>` but no `SegmentTemplate` or `SegmentList`, output just the resolved URL
* If the same `Representation@id` appears in multiple `Period`s, append its segments
* Respect `$RepresentationID$` and substitute it
* Output must be printed as pretty-printed JSON to stdout
