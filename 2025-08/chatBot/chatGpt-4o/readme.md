this model failed to move from two to three passing test files, even after nine
chances, so we are failing this model.

## chance 1

Please return the full Go script that:

- Parses a local MPEG-DASH MPD XML file from a CLI argument: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Uses base URL: `http://test.test/test.mpd`
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs (initialization segment first, if present)
- Resolves nested `<BaseURL>` elements using only `net/url.URL.ResolveReference`
- Handles `SegmentTemplate` substitution of `$RepresentationID$`, `$Number$`, `$Time$` and their formatted forms like `$Number%05d$`
- Supports `SegmentTimeline`, including `r` (repeat) and `t` (time offset) attributes
- Respects `startNumber` and `endNumber` to control how many segments are generated
- Falls back to generating 5 segments if no `SegmentTimeline` or `endNumber` is present
- Supports `<SegmentList>` and `<Initialization>` elements
- Falls back to using the `BaseURL` segment if no other segment info is present
- Uses only the Go standard library

## chance 2

133:2: declared and not used: segmentCount

## chance 3

BaseURL is a string not slice

## chance 4

use only net/url.Parse to build URLs, no other package or logic

## chance 5

Respects `startNumber` and `endNumber` to control how many segments are generated

## chance 6

`base = resolve(base, rep.BaseURL)` incorrectly resolves Representation@BaseURL
a second time

## chance 7

do not ignore errors

## chance 8

`format := result[start+len(key)+1 : end]` incorrectly includes `%`

## chance 9

Appends segments across multiple `<Period>`s for the same `Representation@id`
