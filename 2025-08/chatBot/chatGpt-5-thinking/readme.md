keep code shorter but readable; do not use semicolons as a line-saving trick

## prompt 1, 1m24s

Please return the full Go script that:

- Parses a local MPEG-DASH MPD XML file from a CLI argument: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Uses base URL: `http://test.test/test.mpd`
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs (initialization segment first, if present)

## prompt 2, 2m52s

support SegmentTimeline

## prompt 3, 2m4s

When a representation has only BaseURL and no segment information, use the
already-resolved baseURL directly

## prompt 4, 1m52s

BaseURL is string not slice

## prompt 5, 2m14s

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 6, 2m4s

no idea where you got this logic

Bound by Period@duration if provided

but its completely invalid when `$Number$` is being used

## prompt 7, 2m15s

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## prompt 8, 2m25s

Default `timescale` to `1` if missing
