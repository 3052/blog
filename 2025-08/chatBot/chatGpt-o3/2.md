Hi there! Could you please send me the latest version of the Go program that:

- **Starts** BaseURL resolution with the absolute URL `http://test.test/test.mpd`.
- Treats `<BaseURL>` as a **single string** at each hierarchy level  
  (MPD → Period → AdaptationSet → Representation) and resolves them in that order.
- Supports **SegmentList** and **SegmentTemplate**, including  
  `$RepresentationID$`, `$Number$`, `$Time$` (with optional `%0Nd` zero-padding).
- Handles **initialization segments**.
- Works with either a full `<SegmentTimeline>` *or* the `startNumber` / `endNumber` attributes.
- Outputs a **JSON object** mapping each `Representation@id` to an ordered list of fully resolved segment URLs (initialization first, when present).
