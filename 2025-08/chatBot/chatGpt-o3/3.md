Hi! Please send me the **latest** self-contained Go 1.22 program (standard-library only) that

* starts BaseURL resolution with the absolute URL `http://test.test/test.mpd`,
* treats `<BaseURL>` as a single string at each hierarchy level (MPD → Period → AdaptationSet → Representation) and resolves them in that order,
* fully supports `<SegmentList>` and `<SegmentTemplate>` (including `$RepresentationID$`, `$Number$`, `$Time$` and optional `%0Nd` zero-padding),
* handles initialization segments,
* works with either a complete `<SegmentTimeline>` *or* the `startNumber` / `endNumber` attributes,
* **assumes local input only (no network requests)**,
* **if a Representation supplies its own `<BaseURL>` and there is no `SegmentList` or `SegmentTemplate` at any level, outputs just that single resolved URL**, and
* prints a JSON object mapping every `Representation@id` to an ordered list of fully resolved segment URLs (initialization first when present).
