## chance 1

Please give me the complete Go program (standard library only) that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI (`go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`)
- Starts with `const defaultBase = "http://test.test/test.mpd"`
- Resolves all nested `<BaseURL>` tags using only `net/url.Parse` and `net/url.URL.ResolveReference`
- Outputs a JSON map from each `Representation.ID` to its ordered list of fully resolved segment URLs

## chance 2

~~~
142:40: cannot use &mpd.BaseURL (value of type **BaseURL) as *BaseURL value in
argument to resolveBaseURL
~~~

## chance 3

`end := strings.Index(template[start:], "$")` is not correct as it matches the
starting token

## chance 4

`end += start + 1` is not correct, as it will exclude the final token

## chance 6

complete Go program

## chance 7

complete Go program that reads an MPEG-DASH MPD

## chance 8

Outputs a JSON map from each `Representation.ID` to its ordered list of fully
resolved segment URLs

## chance 9

input should be local file, no network requests

## chance 10

SegmentTemplate@duration is optional
