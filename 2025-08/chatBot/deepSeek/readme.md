## prompt 1, 1m5s

return the full Go script that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Uses `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial MPD URL for resolving all relative BaseURLs
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs

## prompt 2, 1m17s

SegmentTemplate can be child of Representation or AdaptationSet

## prompt 3, 1m14s

86:4: declared and not used: adaptationSetSegmentTemplate

## prompt 4, 1m44s

support SegmentTimeline

## prompt 5, 1m52s

replace `$RepresentationID$`

## prompt 6, 1m17s

use only net/url.URL.ResolveReference to resolve URLs, no other package or logic

## prompt 7, 1m24s

support SegmentTemplate@endNumber

## prompt 8, 1m38s

support SegmentList

## prompt 9, 1m5s

When a representation has only BaseURL and no segment information, use the
already-resolved baseURL directly

## prompt 10, 1m40s

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 11, 1m42s

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## prompt 12, 1m59s

Default `timescale` to `1` if missing

## prompt 13, 2m26s

do not ignore errors

## prompt 14, 48s

`time.ParseDuration(strings.ToLower(durationStr[1:]))` is incorrect because it
leaves the `T`

## prompt 15, 39s

`parseDuration` is invalid because it should only parse a time duration not date

## prompt 16, 33s

`parseDuration` should accept input such as `PT2H13M19.040S`

## prompt 17, 25s

replace input like `$Number%08d$`

## prompt 18, 28s

`strings.Index(result[start:], "$")` is invalid because it matches the opening
`$`

## prompt 19, 23s

`result[start+7 : end]` is invalid because it includes `%`

## prompt 20, 21s

`result[formatStart:end]` is invalid because it includes `%`

## prompt 21, 21s

`result[start+7 : end]` is invalid because it includes `%`

## prompt 22, 1m49s

MPD URL should be first, then MPD@BaseURL, then Period@BaseURL, then
Representation@BaseURL

## prompt 23, 2m34s

full script

## prompt 24, 1m47s

with URL resolve, each URL should build on the previous result

## prompt 25, 2m34s

## 26 OK
