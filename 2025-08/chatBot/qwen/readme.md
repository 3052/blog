## prompt 1, 36s

return the full Go script that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Uses `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial MPD URL for resolving all relative BaseURLs
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs

## prompt 2, 1m3s

how many times do I need to say it, BaseURL field is string not slice, do as I
say

## prompt 3, 20s

all the code should be in a single code block

## prompt 4, 26s

SegmentTemplate can be child of Representation or AdaptationSet

## prompt 5, 30s

support SegmentTimeline

## prompt 6, 28s

replace `$RepresentationID$`

## prompt 7, 33s

include SegmentTemplate@initialization if it exists

## prompt 8, 33s

support SegmentTemplate@endNumber

## prompt 9, 32s

with SegmentList, include Initialization@sourceURL if it exists

## prompt 10, 42s

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 11, 43s

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## prompt 12, 36s

Default `timescale` to `1` if missing

## prompt 13, 40s

replace input like `$Number%08d$`

## prompt 14, 38s

SegmentTemplate@startNumber is `1` if missing

## prompt 15, 4m27s

MPD@BaseURL can be different from MPD URL
