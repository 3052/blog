I reached the limit after 5 prompts

## prompt 1, 37s

return the full Go script that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Uses `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial MPD URL for resolving all relative BaseURLs
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs

## prompt 2, 37s

standard library only

## prompt 3, 31s

BaseURL is string not string slice

## prompt 4, 31s

102:5: declared and not used: mpdBaseURL

## prompt 5, 31s

output should be `map[string][]string`
