## chance 1

Please return a full Go script (using only the standard library) that:

* Parses a local MPEG-DASH MPD XML file passed as a CLI argument: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
* Uses base URL: `http://test.test/test.mpd`
* Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs, with the initialization segment first if present
* Fully supports:

  * `SegmentTemplate` with `$Number$`, `$Time$`, `startNumber`, `endNumber`, and `<SegmentTimeline>`
  * `SegmentList` with `<Initialization>` and `<SegmentURL>`
  * `<BaseURL>` elements at the `Period` and `Representation` levels
* If a `Representation` defines its own `<BaseURL>` but there is no `SegmentTemplate` or `SegmentList` at any level, output just the single resolved URL

## chance 2

each S element should be used 1 + S@r times

## chance 3

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## chance 4

always assume SegmentTemplate@media can include `$Number$`

## chance 5

this section is invalid because as I said you need to respect `$Number$`

~~~
media := strings.ReplaceAll(rst.Media, "$RepresentationID$", rep.ID)
media = strings.ReplaceAll(media, "$Time$", fmt.Sprintf("%d", t))
~~~

## chance 6

no, both `$Number$` and `$Time$` can exist

## chance 7

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## chance 8

Default `timescale` to `1` if missing

## chance 9

respect input like `$Number%08d$`
