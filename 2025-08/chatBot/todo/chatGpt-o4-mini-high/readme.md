this model fails. when attempting the third test file, it reached the max nine
chances without passing the test

## chance 1

Please generate a complete Go program (`main.go`) using only the standard library that:

1. Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
2. Uses `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial MPD URL for resolving all relative BaseURLs
3. Chains BaseURL elements through MPD → Period → AdaptationSet → Representation
4. Supports `<SegmentList>` and `<SegmentTemplate>` at both AdaptationSet and Representation levels
5. Handles `media`, `initialization`, `startNumber`, `endNumber`, and `<SegmentTimeline>` (with `t`, `d`, `r`) attributes
6. Substitutes `$RepresentationID$`, `$Number$`, and `$Time$` into template URLs
7. Prepends any initialization segment URL (with `$RepresentationID$` replaced)
8. Resolves every segment URL to an absolute URL and collects them in order
9. Falls back to the resolved Representation `<BaseURL>` as the single segment URL if neither `<SegmentList>` nor `<SegmentTemplate>` is present
10. Prints a JSON object mapping each `Representation.ID` to its ordered slice of fully-resolved segment URLs
11. Includes full error handling (exit nonzero on any parse/URL error, logging to stderr)

## chance 2

If **both** `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing **and** both
`duration` and `timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments as  
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## chance 3

all BaseURL fields should be type string

## chance 4

support duration like PT2H13M19.040S

## chance 5

SegmentTemplate@timeline is 1 when missing

## chance 6

Appends segments for the same `Representation@id` if it appears in multiple
`<Period>` elements

## chance 7

204:16: undefined: buildFromSegmentList

## chance 8

SegmentTemplate@media can include `$Number$` or `$Time$`

## chance 9

replace input like `$Number%08d$`
