this model fails to pass the first test file, after nine chances

## chance 1

Please show me the complete Go program (using only the standard library) that:

- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI (`go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`)
- Starts with `http://test.test/test.mpd` and chains each `<BaseURL>` (MPD → Period → Representation) via `net/url.URL.ResolveReference`
- Outputs a JSON map from each `Representation.ID` to its ordered list of fully resolved segment URLs

## chance 2

Supports both `<SegmentList>` (with `<Initialization>` and `<SegmentURL>`) and
`<SegmentTemplate>` (handling `initialization`, a `<SegmentTimeline>` with
`$Number$` or `$Time$`, numeric `startNumber`/`endNumber`, or—if no
timeline/endNumber but both `duration` and `timescale` are present—computes
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`)
