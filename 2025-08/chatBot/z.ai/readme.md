return the full Go script that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Uses `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial MPD URL for resolving all relative BaseURLs
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs

## prompt 2, 34s

~~~
83:34: cannot use baseURL.ResolveReference(repURL) (value of type *url.URL) as
url.URL value in assignment
~~~

## prompt 3, 1m1s

SegmentTemplate can be child of Representation or AdaptationSet

## prompt 4, 47s

support SegmentTimeline

## prompt 5, 45s

99:17: declared and not used: repBaseURL

## prompt 6, 36s

include SegmentTemplate@initialization if it exists

## prompt 7, 1m32s

respect Period@BaseURL

## prompt 8, 46s

`$Time$` value should persist across S elements

## prompt 9, 46s

support SegmentList

## prompt 10, 54s

When a representation has only BaseURL and no segment information, use the
already-resolved baseURL directly

## prompt 11, 1m18s

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## prompt 12, 1m38s

default `timescale` to `1` if missing

## prompt 13, 58s

default `startNumber` to `1` if missing

## prompt 14, 21s

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 15, 48s

Period duration comes from Period@duration not Period@start

## prompt 16, 1m

MPD URL is the base, but MPD@BaseURL should also be included if it exists
