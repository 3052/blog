17 U.S.C. 1201(f)(1):

(f) Reverse Engineering.â€”
(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has
lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent
a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular
portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those
elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an
independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not
previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention,
to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute
infringement under this title.
