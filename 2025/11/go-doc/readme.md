# go doc

Go language, I would like to create a package that creates HTML documentation
for a Go package

1. package will be called "doc"
2. do not include any "main.go" or "package main"
3. use a separate file for each type
4. any templates should be a separate file not a string
5. put all package files in the top directory not a subfolder
6. include a test package in folder "example"
7. include a test file in the top folder
8. do not include any other test files
9. when sending file updates, send the complete file, for only new or updated
   files
