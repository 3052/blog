## prompt

a service offers these payment methods

1. visa
2. mastercard
3. american express
4. paypal
5. amazon pay

however I get this when using Amazon Pay:

CheckoutSession cannot be completed: the billing address country US is not
included in the allowed whitelist. Allowed countries: DE

and similar errors with the other methods. how can I get one of these payment
methods? offer one option at a time and I will review the options one by one

## Option 1: Use a Virtual Address Service in Germany

the BIN for my cards will still be US so this is not a valid option

## Option 2: Use a Multi-Currency Account or Virtual Card Service

neither Wise nor Revolut offer German BIN cards to my understanding, if I am
wrong correct me

## Option 3: Use a specialized Virtual Credit Card (VCC) Provider

this is not a valid option as you have not given any example providers

## Option 4 (Revised): Obtain a European Prepaid Card from VIABUY

this is not a valid option as that URL is dead

## Option 5: Use the PayCenter SupremaCard Mastercard

it seems German ID is required, which would make this an invalid option

https://supremacard.de

## Option 6: Use a Service-Specific Gift Card or Voucher

you have ignored the original prompt which does not include this option as a
payment method

## Option 7 (Revised): Use an Assisted Purchase Service from a German Package Forwarder
