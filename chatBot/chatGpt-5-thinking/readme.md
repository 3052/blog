## prompt 1, 1m36s

Please return the full Go script that:

- Parses a local MPEG-DASH MPD XML file from a CLI argument: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Uses base URL: `http://test.test/test.mpd`
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs (initialization segment first, if present)

## prompt 2, 2m9s

use only net/url.URL.ResolveReference to resolve URLs, no other package or logic

## prompt 3, 1m39s

BaseURL is string not slice

## prompt 4, 1m48s

When a representation has only BaseURL and no segment information, use the
already-resolved baseURL directly

## prompt 5, 1m49s

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 6, 2m10s

Period should use its own duration if possible

## prompt 7, 2m18s

missing startNumber is different from startNumber="0"

## prompt 8, 2m29s

SegmentTemplate@endNumber defines the last segment if it exists
