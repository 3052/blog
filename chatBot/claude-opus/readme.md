## prompt 1, 1m2s

return the full Go script that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Uses `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial MPD URL for resolving all relative BaseURLs
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs

## prompt 2, 43s

BaseURL is string not slice

## prompt 3, 39s

262:20: invalid operation: i <= repeat (mismatched types int and int64)

## prompt 4, 12s

344:2: declared and not used: numberRegex

## prompt 5, 22s

include SegmentTemplate@initialization if it exists

## prompt 6, 19s

use only net/url.URL.ResolveReference to resolve URLs, no other package or logic

## prompt 7, 35s

SegmentTemplate@endNumber can be used instead of SegmentTimeline

## prompt 8, 12s

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 9, 46s

use Period duration if its available

## prompt 10, 25s

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## prompt 11, 22s

the current code imports "math" but did not actually use `math.Ceil` as
instructed

## prompt 12, 57s

rebuild the script since you have a flawed understanding of its current state
