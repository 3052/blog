## prompt 1, 1m10s

return the full Go script that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Uses `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial MPD URL for resolving all relative BaseURLs
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs

## prompt 2, 44s

BaseURL is string not slice

## prompt 3, 32s

support SegmentTemplate@endNumber

## prompt 4, 9s

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 5, 2m3s

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## prompt 6, 52s

replace input like `$Number%08d$`

## prompt 7, 1m21s

re write the entire script, since  you are unable to see the broken syntax
