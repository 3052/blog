as can be clearly seen below, this model is too stupid to be useful

## prompt 1, 7s

return the full Go script that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs
- Uses `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial MPD URL for resolving all relative BaseURLs

## prompt 2, 5s

BaseURL is string not slice

## prompt 3, 4s

use only net/url.URL.ResolveReference to resolve URLs, no other package or logic

## prompt 4, 8s

use only net/url.Parse to create URLs, no other package or logic

## prompt 5, 8s

support SegmentTemplate

## prompt 6, 4s

`i := start; i < start+5; i++` hard codes the segment count when I did not ask
for that

## prompt 7, 9s

support SegmentTimeline

## prompt 8, 5s

replace `$Time$`

## prompt 9, 9s

full script

## prompt 10, 10s

include SegmentTemplate@initialization if it exists

## prompt 11, 11s

respect Period@BaseURL

## prompt 12, 5s

respect SegmentTemplate@endNumber

## prompt 13, 10s

full script

## prompt 14, 5s

SegmentTemplate@endNumber can be used instead of SegmentTimeline

## prompt 15, 5s

full script

## prompt 16, 7s

support SegmentList

## prompt 17, 15s

full script

## prompt 18, 14s

with SegmentList, use Representation@BaseURL if it exists

## prompt 19, 5s

When a representation has only BaseURL and no segment information, use the
already-resolved baseURL directly

## prompt 20, 8s

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 23, 16s

Default `timescale` to `1` if missing

## prompt 24, 10s

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## prompt 25, 6s

patch this logic
