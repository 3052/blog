return the full Go script that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Uses `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial MPD URL for resolving all relative BaseURLs
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs

## prompt 2, 45s

support SegmentTimeline

## prompt 3, 35s

the current logic incorrectly assumes that `$Number$` will not exist with
SegmentTimeline

## prompt 4, 40s

`numSegmentsToGenerate = 5` incorrectly limits the segment count

## prompt 5, 39s

BaseURL is string not slice

## prompt 6, 30s

include SegmentTemplate@initialization if it exists

## prompt 7, 28s

keep original output layout as requested

## prompt 8, 46s

use only net/url.URL.ResolveReference to resolve URLs, no other package or logic

## prompt 9, 38s

support SegmentList

## prompt 10, 40s

When a representation has only BaseURL and no segment information, use the
already-resolved baseURL directly

## prompt 11, 36s

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 12, 36s

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## prompt 13, 36s

Default `timescale` to `1` if missing

## prompt 14, 46s

replace input like `$Number%08d$`

## prompt 15, 40s

SegmentTemplate@startNumber is 1 if missing

## prompt 16, 37s

respect SegmentTemplate@endNumber
