after prompt 7, I got this:

Please try again later or use a different model.

## prompt 1, 2m20s

return the full Go script that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Uses `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial MPD URL for resolving all relative BaseURLs
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs

## prompt 2, 42s

BaseURL is string not slice

## prompt 3, 2m48s

support SegmentTemplate

## prompt 4, 1m42s

SegmentTemplate can be child of Representation or AdaptationSet

## prompt 5, 2m33s

support SegmentTimeline

## prompt 6, 2m43s

full script

## prompt 7, 42s

When a representation has only BaseURL and no segment information, use the
already-resolved baseURL directly
