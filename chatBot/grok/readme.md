in response to prompt 21 I got:

Please try again later or use a different model.

## prompt 1, 12s

return the full Go script that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`
- Uses `http://test.test/test.mpd` as the initial MPD URL for resolving all relative BaseURLs
- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs

## prompt 2, 9s

BaseURL is string not slice

## prompt 3, 16s

support SegmentTemplate

## prompt 4, 19s

support SegmentTimeline

## prompt 5, 22s

replace `$RepresentationID$`

## prompt 6, 25s

replace `$Time$`

## prompt 7, 27s

respect Period@BaseURL

## prompt 8, 28s

respect SegmentTemplate@endNumber

## prompt 9, 34s

~~~
xml: Initialization>SegmentURL>media chain not valid with attr flag
~~~

## prompt 10, 34s

~~~
xml: Initialization>sourceURL chain not valid with attr flag
~~~

## prompt 11, 34s

with SegmentList include Initialization@sourceURL if it exists

## prompt 12, 38s

SegmentList.Initialization is an element not attribute

## prompt 13, 37s

with SegmentList, respect Representation@BaseURL if it exists

## prompt 14, 39s

When a representation has only BaseURL and no segment information, use the
already-resolved baseURL directly

## prompt 15, 42s

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 16, 57s

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## prompt 17, 54s

if script does logging it should go to standard error

## prompt 18, 50s

Default `timescale` to `1` if missing

## prompt 19, 57s

support duration like `PT1100.34925S`

## prompt 20, 1m1s

replace input like `$Number%08d$`

## prompt 21, 9s

replace `$Number$` in SegmentTemplate@media
