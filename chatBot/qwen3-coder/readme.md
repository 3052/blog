return the full Go script that:
- Reads an MPEG-DASH MPD XML file path from the CLI: `go run main.go <mpd_file_path>`

- Outputs a JSON object mapping each `Representation@id` to a list of fully resolved segment URLs

## prompt 2, 40s

support SegmentTemplate

## prompt 3, 56s

support SegmentTimeline

## prompt 4, 48s

## prompt 6, 42s

with SegmentList, include Initialization@sourceURL if it exists. note that

attribute of SegmentTemplate

## prompt 7, 42s

Append segments for the same Representation ID if it appears in multiple
Periods

## prompt 8, 1m7s

If both `SegmentTimeline` and `endNumber` are missing, but `duration` and
`timescale` are present, calculate the number of segments using
`ceil(PeriodDurationInSeconds * timescale / duration)`

## prompt 9, 56s

replace input like `$Number%08d$`
